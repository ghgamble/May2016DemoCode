Bootstrap!

	- CSS framework
		- Essentially just a bunch of class selectors with pre-defined CSS rules
		- Focused on responsive and mobile-first development

	- Lots of components
		- Normalization (standardizes the way some elements look by default - Normalize.css)
		- Typography - Fonts, sizes, etc
		- Layout     - Grid system
		- Forms
		- Buttons

Grid System
	- 12 column layout
		12/12 columns => 100% width
		6/12  columns => 50% width

		You will be specifying how many columns (how wide) an element takes up

	- Grid system has a specific layout
		- You NEED to have these classes in order for the grid to work

			1. .container / .container-fluid
			2. .row
			3. .col-*-* (.col-SCREENSIZE-COLUMNS)

		- Column Classes
			.col-xs-8 => on xs screens and up, 8/12 columns
			Screen sizes : xs, sm, md, lg
			columns : 1 - 12

			*** YOU CAN USE MULTIPLE COLUMN CLASSES ON AN ELEMENT!!!  YOU OFTEN WILL! ***

		NOT centered by default
		Row heights are the height of the TALLEST column

	<div class="container">

		<div class="row">

			<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-lg-6"></div>

		</div>

	</div>
