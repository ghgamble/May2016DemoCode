Factories
	- Another component in Angular
	- Registered to a MODULE just like a CONTROLLER
	angular.module('~~~').factory()

	- What are Factories used for?
		- Most often used to hold DATA or common METHODS
		- Can be used in multiple CONTROLLERS

		- Controllers CANNOT communicate with one another
			-	Factories can be used to SHARE information between controllers

	- Factories are SINGLETONS (only ever created ONCE)
		- Passed by REFERENCE anywhere they are INJECTED (tend to be injected into controllers or OTHER factories)
