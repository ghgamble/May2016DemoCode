Factories
	- Another component in Angular
	- Registered to a MODULE just like a CONTROLLER
	angular.module('~~~').factory()

	- What are Factories used for?
		- Most often used to hold DATA or common METHODS
		- Can be used in multiple CONTROLLERS

		- Controllers CANNOT communicate with one another
			-	Factories can be used to SHARE information between controllers

	- Factories are SINGLETONS (only ever created ONCE)
		- Passed by REFERENCE anywhere they are INJECTED (tend to be injected into controllers or OTHER factories)


Filters

	- Filters in Angular are typically used to FORMAT values
		- dates, currency, numbers
		- 1387540982 => Dec 13, 2004
	- Using a filter in an Angular expression
		{{EXPRESSION | FILTER:ARG1:ARG2:etc}}

	- There are a few filters that are special and significantly affect ngRepeat
		- orderBy => sorts and re-orders items
		- filter  => conditionally shows/hides items
