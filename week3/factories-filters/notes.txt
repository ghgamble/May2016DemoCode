# Filters and Factories

## Purpose
The purpose of this lecture is to introduce students to filters and factories. After this lecture, students should feel comfortable with the following concepts:
- Storing application data and low-level logic in factories, to share amongst multiple controllers, and to keep individual controllers as lean as possible.
- Using filters to modify the presentation of data, without affecting the underlying data itself.

## Lecture Notes

### Factories
- Another component in Angular
- Registered to a MODULE just like a CONTROLLER
angular.module('~~~').factory()
- What are Factories used for?
	- Most often used to hold DATA or common METHODS
	- Can be used in multiple CONTROLLERS
	- Controllers CANNOT communicate with one another
	-	Factories can be used to SHARE information between controllers
- Factories are SINGLETONS (only ever created ONCE)
	- Passed by REFERENCE anywhere they are INJECTED (tend to be injected into controllers or OTHER factories)


### Filters

- Filters in Angular are typically used to FORMAT values
	- dates, currency, numbers
	- 1387540982 => Dec 13, 2004
- Using a filter in an Angular expression
	{{EXPRESSION | FILTER:ARG1:ARG2:etc}}
- There are a few filters that are special and significantly affect ngRepeat
	- orderBy => sorts and re-orders items
	- filter  => conditionally shows/hides items
