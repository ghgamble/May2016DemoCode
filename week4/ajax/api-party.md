#API Hack Party

**Explore third-party APIs** that you haven't had time to use, and extend your skillset by make something super cool in a short period of time. We've spent some time building our own APIs and using someone else's. Now you can put those skills to use in a short project to help you see how powerful APIs can be.

#### You have until 4:30pm today!

We'll compete for Coolest Project Award (there might be a **<em>prize</em>**...) for whichever team builds the most useful, interesting, or fun apps on top of third-party APIs.  Use an API that you haven't worked with before!

#### Groups

You will work in groups of 3 for this hack party. Don't forget to establish a good team workflow at the beginning!<br><br>
