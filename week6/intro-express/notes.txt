what does "server side" actually mean?

how do clients and servers communicate with HTTP? (hyper text transfer protocol)

first, send a request to DNS (domain name system) servers, saying we're looking for google.com. The DNS servers tell us google's IP address. Then we can send an HTTP address to the IP address.

Server gets 2 pieces of information:
request type: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
requested url: homepage: /  
about page: /about
