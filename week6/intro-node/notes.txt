NodeJS

What is it?
    - JavaScript runtime environment based on google's v8 engine
    - Node allows us to run JavaScript in places other than the browser
    - Commandline interface

** REMEMBER! **
console.logs are NOT output to the BROWSER
they will be output to your TERMINAL or COMMAND LINE

- Running the command `node` opens up a node REPL
R : Read
E : Evaluate
P : Print
L : Loop

Ctrl + C (even on Mac/Linux) will kill most command line commands

Differences Between Browser / NodeJS
 - No window object / global namespace
 - No document object (no DOM)
 - console.logs go to the TERMINAL / COMMAND LINE

 No Global namespace!? wtf?
 - Node is based off of a module system

Modules - How do we use them?
 - require => allows us to pull a module into a file

 3 ways to access using `require`
    1. Including CORE modules (fs, http)
    2. Include our OWN modules and files (filepath, module.exports/require)
    3. Third party modules - installed from npm (request, express)


Our Node files can take arguments from the command line

    - functions have the `arguments` object
    - Node has the arguments VECTOR `process.argv`

Require method is how we IMPORT modules to a file

module.exports is the variable where we EXPORT information from a file

When you REQUIRE a module, only THAT file has access to the module.  If you need access to a module in multiple files, you MUST require the module in EACH of those files



NPM
    Node Package Manager
    It's where you'll find third party modules for you app

    Also a CLI where you can download those modules and save a record of which ones your app uses
