REST is an architectural style for defining your routes


Stateless - server doesn't need to remember clients between requests

returns JSON data,

sends meaningful status codes


idempotency - an action is idempotent if performing that action once has the same result as performing it many times.

PUT /users/{user_id} - I would expect this to be idempotent

GET, PUT, DELETE are idempotent

POST is not.

POST /users {name : 'steve jobsniak', job : 'babysitter'}
