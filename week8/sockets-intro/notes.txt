WebSockets!
	-  Connections that stay open between a client and a server
	- Bidirectional communication
	- TCP protocol
	- Realtime communication

Library - Socket.io
	- Both client AND server side

	- 2 big methods you'll use
		1. 'on'   -> handling an event (catch)
		2. 'emit' -> creating an event (throw)

When to use / NOT use websockets
	- How important is realtime data?
	- Be careful of how much data/bandwith you're using
		- Use as little data as possible

	- Alternative to sockets
		- Polling
			- AJAX requests on an interval
