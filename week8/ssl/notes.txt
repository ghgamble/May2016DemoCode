SSL? TLS? HTTPS?

SSL(secure socket layer) was a protocol developed by netscape in 1995. After version 3.0, it was rebranded as TLS (transport layer security). Most websites use TLS version 1.2 (version 1.3 is in development)


SSL is a protocol to secure other protocols.

Physicaly layer

network layer (IP)
transport layer (TCP)
security layer (SSL)
application layer (HTTPs, SMTPs, FTPs)

public key cryptography 
private key, used for reading messages (decrypt)
public key, used for writing messages (encrypt)

acquiring an SSL certificate

Tell a CA (certificate authority) that you want a certificate for your domain.
Prove to them that you own the domain you say you own. 
CA gives you a certificate, which is cryptographically signed, so that any client (e.g. browsers) can determine that the cert was issued by the CA, and that it was not tampered with. 


Serving HTTPS traffic:

client connects on port 443
client and server perform SSL handshake, negotiate which type/version of encryption to use (other specifics may vary based on this negotiation)

server sends down the certificate, which contains the server's public key
client confirms that the certificate was not tampered with. 
client sends a random message, encrypted with the public key
server echos back the decrypted random message, proving that they were able to decrypt it. 


we are guaranteed that:
the server is who they say they are (and their cert has not been modified)
our communication with the server is encrypted

Chrome has determined that some features, such as microphone and camera access, or geolocation, are 'powerful features' and can only be used over HTTPS.

want to automatically redirect http traffic to https traffic? Try a dedicated web server like nginx.
